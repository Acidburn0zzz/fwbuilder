<h2>Improvements and bug fixes in libfwbuilder library</h2>
<ul>

  <li>fixed bug #1761373: "libfwbuilder doesn't build on Mandriva
    cooker". Applied fixes to make the code compile with gcc 4.2</li>

</ul>

<h2>Improvements and bug fixes in the policy importer for iptables</h2>
<ul>
  <li>fixed bug #1764988: "iptables import -> GUI crash":
    <p>
      <ul>

        <li>iptables policy importer recognizes and parses target
          RETURN</li>

        <li>iptables policy importer recognizes and parses TCP flag
          parameters ALL and NONE</li>

        <li>syntax for TCP flag matching in iptables-save should allow
          for more than 2 flags in 'comp' part</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
  </li>

  <li>fixed bug (no num): iptables policy importer should properly
    parse numeric protocol specification (e.g. "-p 47").</li>

  <li>added missing supprot for "--log-tcp-sequence",
"--log-tcp-options" and "--log-ip-options" options for target LOG to
    iptables policy importer</li>

  <li>added a workaround for a situation when several iptables
    commands pass control to the same user-define chain in the
    iptables-save file. As of fwbuilder v2.1, branch ruleset is a
    child object of PolicyRule. This means two different rules can not
    point at the same branch ruleset. This is unfortunate but it is
    hard to fix in the current version because it requires changes XML
    DTD and API. Will do this in 3.0. Meanwhile, checking if branch
    ruleset with requested name already exists and change the name by
    adding suffix '1', '2' etc to make it different. Imported rule is
    marked as 'bad' (red background) and gets a comment explaining
    this.</li>

  <li>fixed bug (no num): importer for iptables should properly assign
    rule options when it finds "-m limit" and "--limit" options in the
    input file.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Improvements and bug fixes in the GUI</h2>
<ul>
  <li>configure.in: another patch by Carlos Silva
      &lt;r3pek@r3pek.org&gt; to add third parameter to
      AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED </r3pek>

  <li>fixed bug reported in Debian Bug report #417685 - added missing
      #include <algorithm> to make code compile with gcc 4.3</li>

  <li>applied patch by Carlos Silva &lt;r3pek@r3pek.org&gt; to make
      configure.in use ANTLR C++ run-time installed on the system if
    it can find one; otherwise it uses copy in src/antlr</li>

  <li>fixed bug #1772722: "installer should recognize when it uses
    plink 0.60". We detect when installer uses plink on Windows by
    checking the name of the configured ssh client. The check should
    be case-insensitive.</li>

  <li>fixed bug #1764971: "allowed value range for burst
    limit". Iptables "--limit-burst" option should not be limited in
    the GUI.</li>

</ul>
