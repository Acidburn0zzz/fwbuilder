Improvements and bug fixes in the GUI

     * fixed bug #1661140: "built-in installer broken in 2.1.9 for PF".
       Installer incorrectly set name for files it copied to the firewall if
       generated configuration consisted of several files. Affected platforms
       are PF and ipfilter because normally for these platforms compiler
       generates two files.
     * fixed bug #1659832: "No compile with QT without STL support"
     * a workaround for the bug 1629461: "Policy tabs do not scroll @ window
       extent on OSX". The tab widget used to show policy, nat, routing and
       policy branch rulesets does not switch to a "folded" mode on Mac OS X
       when it needs to show more tabs that fit in the window. Since I can't
       figure out a way to force it to do that, I am dropping "Policy/" from
       the tab titles for branches to make them shorter. This will help users
       with policies with many branches, however it does not solve the
       problem because as they keep adding branches, at some point they won't
       fit in the window again.
     * added an item "Where used" to the context menu associated with objects
       in rules
