   GUI and compilers v2.0.1 require API library libfwbuilder version 2.0.1

Summary

   Firewall Builder GUI v2.0.1 is a maintenance release that includes fixes for bugs discovered
   since 2.0 has been released.

   For those who wish to build from source, instructions are outlined in "Install and Build
   instructions"

Bugs fixed in libfwbuilder API:

     * bug #1001725: "object with empty name can not be deleted". the problem was caused by the
       algorithm used in FWObject::getPath. If object had had a blank name, the path returned by
       this method would end with the name of its parent without slash.

Bugs fixed in GUI:

     * bug #1001521: "Cant create ICMP service". ICMP Service dialog did not save icmp code and
       type numbers in the object.
     * bug #1001275: "object duplication fails w/ no action". GUI used to not allow user to
       duplicate IP address object. Now any object can be duplicated so that the copy is placed
       under the same parent, including IP address.
     * bug #1000862: "Creating groups in Deleted Objects". Library "Deleted objects" should not
       be offered as a choice for "group objects" operation.
     * bug #1000485: "Firewalls in the drop-down box not ordered". List of firewalls in the
       pull-down that controls policy views is now alphabetically sorted on program startup.
     * there were two TCP Service objects "linuxconf" in the Standard objects library. Object
       with ID id3AED0D6D has been removed. It seems this object has been duplicated long time
       ago (at least it was like this in 1.1.2)
     * bug #1002388: "Clamp MSS to MTU" option was missing in 2.0
     * bug #1001833: fixed memory leak that appeared when autosave option was used
     * bug #1003068: "object copy/paste not always working". IP address object could not be
       placed under interface using copy/paste operation. Now ip address object can be pasted to
       interface as well as to Objects/Addresses folder.
     * Operation File/discard could not be used if the file was upgraded. Changed the way
       operation File/Discard works: it now closes the file, discards all the changes that have
       been made to it and replaces it with a fresh copy of the head revision from RCS. This
       works if user wants to abort file upgrade when they switch to the new version of
       fwbuilder.

Bugs fixed in iptables policy compiler fwb_ipt:

     * bug #1004153 "limit-burst = 0 is not valid". Iptables does not accept the rule using
       "limit-burst" option if it is set to zero.
