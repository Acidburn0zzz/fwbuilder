<h2>Changes in the GUI</h2>

<p>
  <b>The editor panel and object tree are now detachable.</b> You can
  "float" these windows and rearrange them on the screen any way you
  want. There is only one editor panel even when you open several data
  files at the dame time. Each data file is opened in its own project
  window with object tree and rules.
</p>

<p>
  Selection of the object in the tree or rules does not automatically
  open it in the editor anymore. Use double click or context menu item
  "Edit" to open object in the editor. This helps, for example, when
  you need to populate large object group and need to switch between
  libraries to find objects. Switching to another library or
  accidentally clicking on a wrong object in the tree does not cause
  editor to switch.
</p>

<p>
  <b>"Single rule compile"</b>: After you select a rule in policy or
  NAT rule set, you can compile it and see the result in the editor
  panel immediately if you hit "X" on the keyboard or use context menu
  that appears if you click right mouse button. The result is shown in
  the editor panel immediately. To select a rule click anywhere in it
  (any rule element, not just rule number).
</p>

<p>
  <b>Error and warning messages</b> generated by the policy compilers
  are highlighted using red and blue colors in the compiler output
  panel when you compile single rule. When you compile all rules of
  the firewall using toolbar buttons or main menu items "Compile" or
  "Install", errors and warnings are also highlighted in the
  dialog. Clicking on the error or warning message opens corresponding
  firewall and selects the rule that caused it.
</p>

<p>
  A new <b>"Filter"</b> input field is located above the object tree.
  Typing fragment of the name in this field automatically limits set
  of objects shown in the tree to those that match what was typed. The
  filter maintain history of strings entered in it for the duration of
  the session.
</p>

<p>
  Right above the panel showing rules there are now two new buttons. These
  allow you to compile and install policy for the firewall object shown 
  in the rules panel at the moment. The same functions are available via context
  menu associated with the firewall or cluster object in the object
  tree, but these buttons are easier to use.
</p>

<p>
  The GUI can show <b>brief summary of object attributes</b> in the
  second column in the object tree. This is controlled by a checkbox
  in the global preferences dialog, tab "Objects". This is off by
  default. The first column always shows object icon and its name, the
  second (optional) column shows its attributes. Interface label is
  shown in the second column. The width of both columns in the tree is
  set automatically to accommodate all the text, then can be adjusted
  by the user using mouse. Column width is saved in settings and will
  be restored upon program restart. Column width is saved per-file,
  per-library.
</p>

<p>
  Now you can <b>change ip addresses of interfaces of the new firewall
  created from a template</b>. Templates come preconfigured with some
  IP addresses which probably do not match addresses used on your
  networks. When you create new firewall object from a template, the
  "new firewall" wizard includes interface editor page where you can
  change addresses and interface types (static or dynamic). The
  program not only changes addresses of interfaces, it also scans
  policy and NAT rules of the template looking for network objects
  that match original temlpate addresses and replaces them with
  network objects that match new ones.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Password caching</b>: Built-in installer can remember
  firewall password (and enable password for Cisco) for the
  duration of the session. Passwords are never stored permanently
  in any form, encrypted or plain text. You need to enter
  password once when you activate generated policy. If you keep
  the program open and need to modify and activate policy again, the
  password fields in the installer dialog can be filled
  automatically. The feature is optional and is off by default.
  Cached passwords are associated with the firewall object and
  account name used to activate policy.
</p>

<p>
  The program supports <b>new types of interfaces</b>: VLAN, bridge,
  bonding. This is fully implemented for Linux and partially for other
  platforms.  VLANs are added as child objects of an interface, like
  so:
</p>

<img src="vlan_interfaces.png" style="float: left; padding: 10px;">

<p>
  The GUI checks the name of the vlan subinterface against  naming convention
  for vlan interfaces on the chosen OS. For example, both "eth0.100" and "vlan100"
  are supported on Linux, while on Cisco IOS or PIX it should be 
  "FastEthernet0/1.101"
</p>

<p>
  See <a href="#bridge">below</a> for more details on the bridge interfaces implementation.
</p>

<p>
  The program can <b>generate commands to configure vlans, bridges and
    bonding interfaces</b> on Linux. This is off by default and
    controlled by checkboxes in the "script" tab of the firewall
    object dialog. Generated script adds and removes vlans, bridges,
    bridge ports, bond and bond slaves incrementally. That is, the
    script analyzes existing vlan interfaces and compares them with
    vlan interfaces defined in the Firewall Builder GUI and then adds
    new ones and removes those that do not exist in fwbuilder. The
    same algorithm is used to create bridges, add or remove bridge
    ports and create bonds and then add or remove slave interfaces.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Configlets</b>: generated firewall script (for all platforms) is
  assembled from small fragments we call "configlets". These fragments
  are located in the /usr/share/fwbuilder/configlets (on Linux). Each
  configlet is a template that uses specially defined macros which the
  program replaces with actual strings and values when it generates
  firewall configuration. There are separate templates for different
  firewall platforms and for different parts of the configuration file
  to be created. Supported macros include simple variable expansion
  and conditional "If - then" construct. You can override configlets
  we provide with your own if you create directory
  "fwbuilder/configlets" in your home directory and place files with
  the same name there. This way, you can change virtually all aspects
  of generated configuration file.
</p>

<p>
  Built-in policy installer gets commands that it needs to execute on
  the firewall from configlets. Two configlets are used for Unix-based
  firewalls (Linux, OpenWRT, Sveasoft, IPCOP and its variants,
  OpenBSD, FreeBSD, MacOSX, Solaris): "installer_commands_reg_user"
  and "installer_commands_root". You can change the behavior of the
  installer without having to touch C++ code, just create a copy of
  the configlet file in $HOME/fwbuilder/configlets and modify it.
</p>

<p>
  Terminology for policy rule actions that create branching in the
  rule set or tag packets has been unified. Now we call these actions
  <b>"Branch"</b> and <b>"Tag"</b> for all platforms. Before, the name
  was different and matched original action on each platform, that is
  for PF it was "Anchor" and "Tag" and for iptables "Chain" and "Mark"
  respectively.
</p>

<p>
  <b>"Find where used"</b> function can now find all uses of the given
  object, as well as all uses of its children. For example, if the
  object is firewall, then this function can find all groups and rules
  that refer to it directly, or to it and all its interfaces and their
  addresses. This extension is optional, it is controlled by a
  checkbox in the "Find" dialog.
</p>

<p>
  Added a <b>place in the global Preferences dialog for options
  specific for different object types</b>. First parameters include
  options for DNSName and AddressTable to let the user decide if the
  newly created objects of these types should be automatically
  configured with "Compile Time" or "Run Time" mode. Also, added an
  option that makes <b>DNSName object editor copy the name of the
  object into the DNS record input field</b> when new object is
  created or whenever the name changes.  This is useful when the user
  does not want to keep object name and dns record different because
  they need to enter the name only once.
</p>

<p>
  <b>"Batch install"</b> checkbox moved to the page that shows
  compiler progress so the user can decide to do batch install right
  before they perform installations instead of doing this before they
  start compile.
</p>

<p>
  Standard objects library now comes with new IPv6 Network
  objects. These objects represent IPv6 networks that should not be
  routed on the Internet. Included: RFC3849 "Documentation Network"
  2001:db8::; RFC4291 "Link local" fe80::/10; RFC4773 "Experimental
  Network" 2001:0000::/29 to 2001:01F8::/29. Also added a group "ipv6
  private" that includes all these networks.
</p>

<a name="cluster"></a>
<h2>Support for High Availability configurations</h2>

<p>
  Test data file <b>cluster.fwb</b> with examples of different cluster
  configurations <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/examples/cluster.fwb">is available for download here</a>.
</p>

<p>
New object type "Cluster" (located under Clusters in the tree)
represents the HA pair.  You configure policy and NAT rules in the
rule sets of this object rather than in the actual firewalls.
</p>

<p>
  Here is what you need to do to set up HA configuration:
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create your firewall objects. Assign platform and host OS and
      name interfaces as usual. Do not add any policy or NAT
      rules. These are your real (member) firewalls. Interfaces should
      have their real IP addresses (not CARP or VRRP addresses).
    </li>

    <li>
      Create a Cluster object which you configure with proper platform
      and host OS. Use the usual "New Object" menu or toolbar button
      to create this object. Note that in order for the firewall
      object to become a member of a cluster, their platform and host
      OS settings must match.
    </li>

    <li>
      The program guides you through the process of creation of the
      new Cluster object using wizard-like dialog. You start with the
      list of firewall objects where you choose which firewalls should
      become members of the cluster. Next, the program finds
      interfaces of the member firewalls that have the same name and
      can be part of the cluster and creates cluster interfaces with
      the same name. Not all interfaces are eligible, for example
      bridge ports, bonding interface slaves or parents of vlan
      interfaces can not be used for the cluster. Cluster interfaces
      define failover groups. You can add, remove or rename cluster
      interfaces, as well as change which interfaces of the member
      firewalls are used with each one. On the next page of the wizard
      you can change failover protocols and add, remove or change IP
      addresses of cluster interfaces. Not all failover protocols
      require IP addresses, for example VRRP or CARP do but heartbeat
      or OpenAIS don't. Finally, you can choose to use policy and NAT
      rules of one of the member firewalls to populate Policy and NAT
      rule sets of the new cluster. If this is done, all references to
      the original member firewall and its interfaces in rules are
      replaced with references to the cluster and its interfaces. The
      program also creates backup copies of the member firewall
      objects with the name with suffix "-bak" and clears Policy and
      NAT rule sets of the member firewall objects used with the
      cluster before new cluster is created.
    </li>

    <li>
      OpenBSD or FreeBSD cluster gets carp interfaces. Name them
      "carp0", "carp1" or whatever indexes they have on your
      machines. You can add CARP password and ID at the same time, but
      if you don't, you can add them later.
    </li>

    <li>
      If you use heartbeat or OpenAIS (on Linux) for failover, cluster
      interfaces should have the same names as corresponding member
      firewall interfaces. In this case, cluster interfaces are
      virtual entities that represent interfaces of the corresponding
      member firewalls. The program will make substitution when it
      compiles rules. This is also how it works for PIX failover
      configuration.
    </li>

    <li>
      Each cluster interface has child "Failover group" object with
      the name "firewall:carp0:members" or similar.  This is where you
      configure associated member firewall interfaces.  Double click
      this object in the tree and then click "Manage Members" button
      in the dialog. Select interfaces of the member firewalls in the
      panel on the left hand side and click arrow button to add them
      to the list on the right. Use checkbox to select master. Click
      OK when done. The platform and host OS of the cluster object and
      members must match, otherwise firewall objects do not appear in
      the "members" dialog panel.
    </li>

    <li>
      Besides interfaces, the Cluster object has a new child object
      "State Sync Group". This group represents state synchronization
      protocol. Currently <b>pfsync</b> is supported for OpenBSD and
      <b>conntrackd</b> for Linux. To configure, double click it in
      the tree to open it in the dialog and click "Manage
      Members". Select interfaces of the member firewalls in the panel
      on the left hand side and click arrow button to add them to the
      list on the right. Use checkbox to select master. Click OK when
      done. They should appear in the "members" table in the State
      Sync Group dialog. The platform and host OS of the cluster
      object and members must match, otherwise firewall objects do not
      appear in the "members" dialog panel.
    </li>

    <li>
      Button "Edit protocol parameters" allows you to edit some
      parameters for chosen failover protocol. This is where you can
      configure an address and port for heartbeat and OpenAIS.
    </li>

    <li>
      There are few new checkboxes in the "Script" tab of the firewall
      object dialog. These allow you to control whether the program
      will add shell commands to create and configure bonding, bridge
      and VLAN interfaces.
    </li>

    <li>
      Compile by clicking right mouse button on the cluster object and
      using menu item "Compile". This will in fact compile each member
      firewall separately so you'll get .fw and .conf files for both
      of them.
    </li>

    <li>
      Again, you configure all the rules in the policy and NAT rule
      sets that belong to the cluster object. If you put cluster's
      interfaces in rules, the program replaces them with interfaces
      of the member firewall when it compiles rules. If you put
      cluster object in a rule, it is like if you put member firewall
      object there instead, except the program automatically picks the
      member firewall it compiles the policy for.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<a name="pix_cluster"></a>
<h2>Cluster configuration for PIX</h2>

<p>
  Firewall Builder supports PIX "lan based" failover configuration.
  Unlike in Linux or BSD, where each interface of the firewall runs
  its own instance of failover protocol, PIX runs one instance of
  failover protocol over dedicated interface. PIX can also run state
  synchronization protocol over the same or another dedicated
  interface. These dedicated interfaces should be connected via
  separate switch and do not see regular traffic. Here is how this is
  implemented in Firewall Builder:
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Like with all other supported firewall platforms, interface
      objects that belong to a cluster object serve to establish
      association between actual interfaces of the member
      firewalls. Cluster interface object should have the same name as
      corresponding member firewall interfaces. It should have
      Failover Group child object which should be configured with
      interfaces of the member firewalls. You can create Failover
      Group object using context menu item "Add Failover Group", the
      menu appears when you right mouse click on the cluster interface
      object. Here is how it should look like:
    </li>

    <p>
      <img src="cluster_interfaces.png"/>
    </p>

    <li>Interface that is configured for the failover on the member
      firewall should be marked as "Dedicated Failover". Use checkbox
      with this name in the interface object dialog to do this.
    </li>

    <li>
      Cluster interface that corresponds to the failover interface of
      the members should be configured with protocol "PIX failover
      protocol". Click on the "Edit protocol parameters" button to edit
      timeout, poll time and the key.
    </li>
      
    <li>Cluster interfaces that represent regular interfaces of the
      members also must have failover group objects; that is where you
      add interfaces of the member firewalls. There is no need to
      configure protocol in these failover groups because PIX does not
      run it over these interfaces. Regular interfaces should not be
      marked as "Dedicated Failover".
    </li>
    
    <li>Cluster object should have State Synchronization group child
      object. Create it using context menu "Add State Synchronization
      Group" item if this object does not exist. In this object you
      need to configure member interfaces that should be used for
      state synchronization. You can use separate dedicated interfaces
      or the same interfaces used for failover. If these are separate,
      corresponding interface objects of the member firewalls must be
      marked as "Dedicated Failover".
    </li>

    <li>One of the member firewall interfaces used in the State
      Synchronization group must be marked as "master". This is where
      you define which PIX unit is going to be the primary and which
      is going to be the secondary in the HA pair.
    </li>

    <li>
      Here is an example of the state synchronization and failover using
      the same interface Ethernet2:
      <p>
        <img src="state_sync_configuration.png"/>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>Dedicated failover interfaces of the member firewalls must
      have IP addresses and these addresses must be different but
      belong to the same subnet.
    </li>


  </ul>
</p>

<a name="bridge"></a>
<h2>Changes in the support for bridging firewalls</h2>

<p>
  Skip this if you do not use Firewall Builder to configure iptables
  firewalls in bridging configuration. Otherwise, please read on.
</p>

<p>
  Previous versions of Firewall Builder provided an attribute "bridge
  port" in the dialog of the Interface object. If an interface marked
  as "bridge port" was used in the "Interface" column of a policy
  rule, fwbuilder policy compiler used "--physdev-in" or
  "--physdev-out" option instead of conventional "-i" or "-o"
  option. The attribute "bridge port" has been deprecated in the new
  version. You need to make changes to your firewall and interface
  objects manually in order to make your old configurations compile
  properly with new version of Firewall Builder.
</p>

<p>
  First, check if you have an interface object to represent the
  bridge. Usually it will have a name <b>br0</b> or similar. If you
  do not have this interface object in the firewall in Firewall
  Builder, please create it. Regardless whether this object existed
  before or you just created it, open it in the editor and click
  <b>"Advanced Interface Settings"</b> button in the dialog. This
  button and the dialog it opens are new in this version of the
  program. In the dialog that appears use drop-down menu "Device Type"
  to set its type to <b>"Bridge"</b>. Then click "OK" to close the
  dialog and save configuration.
</p>

<p>
  Next, find interface objects that should represent bridge ports and
  simply drag them and drop under the interface <b>br0</b> (copy/paste
  works too). In the end, these interfaces become "children"
  of <b>br0</b> and should be located in the branch of the tree rooted
  at <b>br0</b>. The program displays a comment "bridge port" next to
  the name of an interface like this in the tree. Here is how it looks
  like:
</p>

<img src="new_bridge_interfaces.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">

<p>
  In this configuration we have bridge interface <b>br0</b> and two
  bridge ports <b>eth0</b> and <b>eth1</b>. Note how <b>eth0</b>
  and <b>eth1</b> are located in the tree under <b>br0</b>, on the
  same level as its IP address object.
</p>

<p>
  This is it, bridge port interfaces will be recognized by the program
  again and it will generate proper iptables configuration.
</p>



<a name="iptables"></a>
<h2>Changes in the policy compiler for iptables</h2>

<p>
  When an <b>interface with dynamic address</b> is used in a policy or
  NAT rule, compiler generates shell script to read its ip addresses
  at the time of execution, assigns them to temporary shell variables
  and uses them in rules. In previous versions (fwbuilder v2 and v3)
  only the first IPv4 address of an inetrface was used. V4 uses all
  IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the interface by creating a shell "for"
  loop in the script. Note that support for dynamic IPv6 addresses 
  was broken in v3 completely, it was fixed in v4.
</p>

<p>
  Policy compiler for iptables can generate shell commands to
  configure bridge, bonding and vlan interfaces (see above).
</p>

<p>
  Added support for option "--random" in SNAT rules
</p>

<p>
  Generated script can adjust <b>conntrack</b> kernel module
  parameters to tune its performance for firewalls that handle heavy
  traffic.
</p>

<p>
  Generated iptables script now has standard structure per LSB ("Linux
  Standard Base Core Specification 3.1"). The script has the following
  actions controlled by the command line arguments: "start", "stop",
  "reload", "status". Action "start" reconfigured interfaces and then
  flushes current iptables tables and chains and loads new iptables
  configuration. Action "stop" flushes all tables and chains and sets
  default policy in all chains to "DROP" to shut down the firewall to
  all kinds of traffic. It can also optionally install iptables rules
  to permit ssh access to the firewall from the management
  workstation.  Action "status" returns return code per LSB
  specification. Code 0 means the firewall is loaded and is running
  (but it does not check that the rules it is running with are those
  defined in fwbuilder). Return code 3 means iptables modules are not
  loaded or there are no tables. This return code means the firewall
  is not running or not configured.  It also supports additional
  actions "interfaces" and "test_interfaces". Action "interfaces" only
  runs commands that manage ip addresses of interfaces, as well as
  configure vlan, bridge and bonding interfaces. Action
  "test_interfaces" runs the same commands in the test mode when it
  prints commands that would be executed but does not actually execute
  them.
</p>

<p>
  Firewall Builder v4.0 comes with experimental integration
  with <b>IPCOP</b> firewalls. To turn it on, choose platform
  "iptables" and host OS "IPCOP firewall appliance". Generated script
  is supposed to be installed on the firewall as
  /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall.local and restarted by the command
  "/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall restart". Built-in policy installer in
  Firewall Builder GUI installs it using this name and run the restart
  command to activate it. Firewall Builder does not manage interfaces
  of IPCOP firewall to avoid conflicts with IPCOP itself, use
  fwbuilder only to generate iptables rules. The program comes with
  some template objects for IPCOP firewalls, you can use them when you
  create new Firewall object if you choose to create it from a
  template.
</p>

<p>
  Another new host OS supported in Firewall Builder v4.0 is
  <b>OpenWRT</b>. This OS is very close to the stock Linux, the only
  difference is path to the system utilities such as lsmod, modprobe,
  vconfig and others can be slightly different.
</p>


<a name="fwbedit"></a>
<h2>Changes in the command linbe tool fwbedit</h2>

<p>
  User can now <b>merge objects from two data files</b> together using
  command line tool <b>fwbedit</b> just like the "Import library"
  function in the GUI.
</p>
