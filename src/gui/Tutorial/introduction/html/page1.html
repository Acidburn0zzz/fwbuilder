<h2>Common Actions</h2>

<p>
  Firewall Builder is based on the concept of objects. Before you can
  use an object in a firewall rule it must first exist in an object
  Library. Commonly used objects, like the HTTP service, are
  predefined in the Standard Library. The User Library contains
  objects, like internal IP networks, that users create to match their
  specific network environments.
