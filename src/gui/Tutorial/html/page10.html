  The tree and editor panels in Firewall Builder 4.0 are detachable
  and can "float". You can rearrange them on the screen to keep them
  away when you do not need them but still within reach so you can
  quickly find objects and change their properties. Use main menu
  "View" to open and close panels; the tree panel can be opened and
  closed using keyboard shortcut Ctrl+T.
