  The newly created firewall object is shown below. Its name is
  "guardian", and it appears in the object tree in the left hand side
  of the main window in the folder "Firewalls". Double-clicking the
  object in the tree opens it in the editor panel at the bottom panel
  of the main window. The editor for the firewall object allows you to
  change its name, platform and host OS, and also provides buttons
  that open dialogs for "advanced" settings for the firewall platform
  and host OS.
