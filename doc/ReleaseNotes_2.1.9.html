<br>
<h2> Version  2.1.9   </h2>
<br>
<p>
Released 02/10/2007
<br>
<b>GUI and compilers v2.1.9 require API library libfwbuilder version 2.1.9</b>
<br>
<h2>Summary </h2>
<p>
This is bugfix release.

<p>
<b>For those who wish to build from source, instructions are outlined
in the document "Install and Build instructions" on our web site <a
href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/archives/cat_installation.html">here</a></b>



<h2>Improvements and bug fixes in the GUI</h2>
<ul>

  <li>New feature: new operation "Tools/Find Conflicting Objects in
    Two Data Files". This operation inspects two data files (either
    .fwb or .fwl) and finds conflicting objects. Conflicting objects
    have the same internal ID but different attributes. Two data files
    can not be merged, or one imported into another, if they contain
    such objects. This operation also helps identify changes made to
    objects in two copies of the same data file. This operation does
    not find objects present in one file but not in the other, such
    objects present no problem for merge or import operations. This
    operation works with two external files, neither of which needs to
    be opened in the program. Currently opened data file is not
    affected by this operation and objects in the tree do not
    change. In the process of this operation user is presented with
    series of dialogs showing conflicting objects side by side. In the
    end the program can generate report and write it to a text
    file.</li>


  <li>installOptionsDialog was too large and did not fit on some
    laptop screens. Doing tricks to make sure the dialog properly
    resized after unused GUI elements are hidden.
  </li>

  <li>bug #1629521: "can't delete empty chain/policy tab"</li>

  <li>bug #1619842: "prolog "script editor" opens behind other
  windows"</li>

  <li>bug #1620206: "RuleOptions' "Apply" button greyed-out until menu
    selection"</li>

  <li>bug 1619930: "Prolog tab's ScriptEditor's import fails to
    overwrite"</li>

  <li>bug #1617501:"Install fails after compile". The GUI got confused
    when user enter full path to the policy file in the "Output file
    name" input field in the "Compiler" tab of firewall object
    dialog. Making sure we always strip directory path from the file
    name if user specified full path for the policy file in the
    "Output file name" input field in the "Compiler" tab of firewall
    object dialog. Need to strip path when macro "%FWSCRIPT%" is
    substituted in installation scriptlets and in some other
    places.</li>

  <li>"Apply" and "Close" buttons in the objct editor panel should be
    of fixed size horizontally</li>

  <li>bug #1624577: "group window doesn't stay open on
    multiple-adds". Using special flag to tell ObjectTreeView that it
    should ignore MouseReleaseEvent it gets after d&d operation, so it
    wont switch object in the editor panel. Note the bug triggered
    only on Mac OS X.</li>

  <li>bug (no num.): GUI used show fanthom 'Policy', 'NAT' and
    'Routing' tabs when user deleted objects from the Deleted Objects
    library, provided some of these objects were previously deleted
    firewalls.</li>

  <li>bug #1620284: "conflict when adding library to
    Preferences/Libraries". When the user tried to add a library to
    the list in Preferemces/Libraries when a data file with the same
    object library was loaded, the GUI detected the conflict and
    showed error dialog.</li>

  <li>bug #1650369: "[patch] please add support for
    GNU/kFreeBSD". Applied patch to make code compile on kFreeBSD.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Compiler for iptables</h2>
<ul>
  <li>bug #1623338: "Can not disable rules in a branch". Compiler for
    iptables ignored flag 'disabled' on rules in a branch.
  </li>

  <li>bug #1623113: 'connlimit fails in compiled "address table"
    rules' Module connlimit can only be used in iptables rules
    matching TCP services.  Such iptables commands have "-p tcp"
    and/or "-m tcp" options. If a rule in fwbuilder uses TCP Service
    and connlimit option and has multiple objects in src and dst,
    optimizer used to split it to minimize matches. It however
    preserved connlimit option in all subrules, even though some of
    them did not have TCP service after the split. This lead to
    generation of incorrect iptables commands.</li>

  <li>bug #1620925: "compile-time AddressTable object with empty
    file".  Compile-time AddressTable object that uses file with no
    addresses should be treated as an empty group according to the
    "Ignore empty groups" option.</li>

  <li>bug #1618381: "CLASSIFY/MARK are non-terminating". This bug
  report in fact  reported several problems.
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>For action Branch with option to add branching rule to the
          mangle table: we now generate rules in PREROUTING,
          POSTROUTING, INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD chains. This is
          because some targets can only work in PREROUTING or
          POSTROUTING chains but we do not know what rules will user
          put in the branch. So we need to branch in all chains
        </li>

        <li>For rules in mangle table with direction set to Inbound or
          Outbound force chain to PREROUTING or POSTROUTING
          respectively early. This eliminates duplicates such as the
          same rule in PREROUTING and INPUT chains. Also since most
          (all?) targets that require mangle table go into either
          PREROUTING or POSTROUTING chains, it should be enough to use
          these two chains.
        </li>

        <li>Non-terminating rules shadow each other "backwards", that
          is more general rule shadows other rules _above_ it. Added
          flag 'reverse' to the method find_more_general_rule and
          added new rule processor
          DetectShadowingForNonTerminatingRules that finds such cases
          of 'reverse' shadowing. Using it for rules in the mangle
          table for iptables.
        </li>

        <li>Adding iptables rule with target ACCEPT to emulate
          terminating behavior for Tag and Classify actions. Emulation
          is controlled by a global option in the "Compiler" tab of
          the firewall properties dialog (default is "off"). This
          means emulation can be turned on and off for all rules that
          might require it at once. It is impossible to mix such rules
          with terminating and non-termninating behavior. The reason
          for this is that shadowing detection algorithm can only work
          with either terminating or non-terminating rules, not with
          the mix. </li>

      </ul>
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>bug #1628989: "run-time-loaded rules don't accept ";" as line
    comment"</li>
  
  <li>bug #1632054: "Runtime AddressObjects FAIL to load if "Name:"
    contains "."". Compiler checks if the name of the run-time
    AddressTable object contains characters that have special meaning
    in sheel and relaces them with '_' when it generates the name of
    the temporary shell variable.</li>

  <li>bug (no num.): data files used for run-time AddressTable objects
    can have empty lines, the script should skip them.</li>
