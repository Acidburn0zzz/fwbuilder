<p>
  Screenshot below shows IP address of interface eth0. The address and
  netmask are attributes of the child object of the type "IPv4
  address". Here the address is "192.0.2.1" and netmask
  "255.255.255.0". (Netmask can also be specified using slash
  notation, such as 24, without the actual slash.) Button DNS Lookup
  can be used to determine IP address using DNS. The program runs DNS
  query for the "A" record for the name of the parent firewall
  object. (This only works if the firewall object has the same name as
  the actual firewall machine.)
