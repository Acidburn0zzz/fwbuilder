<h2>GUI Updates</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1703 "importing iptables line with module pkttype causes
      parser error". We do not have any object with the behavior
      closely resembling that of iptables module "pkttype" so the
      importer creates CustomService object with the code taken from
      the original iptables rule. SF bug 3065435
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed SF bug 3049665 "Firewall Settings -&gt; Output file name
      misses .fw extension"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed how we append suffix ".fw" to the name of generated script
      when it is preconfigured in the firewall settings dialog and
      already includes ".fw" suffix (it was added twice).
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Fixed #1699 installation session status was reset from "failure"
      to "success" in a configuration where fwbuilder gui was running
      on Windows and talked to Cisco router using pscp.exe and
      plink.exe and ssh session failed because of authentication
      failure. This happened because plink.exe terminated with return
      status "success" even in case of authentication failure.
    </p>
  </li>


  <li>
    <p>
      	fixed #1724 . There was a problem with pscp.exe and putty
	sessions. Plink.exe accepts session name in place of the host name
	on the command line, but pscp.exe does not. We ask user to enter
	session name in the "alternative name or address to use to
	communicate with the firewall" input field in the "Installer" tab
	of the firewall settings dialog and then use it in place of the
	host name in the command line for pscp.exe and plink.exe. This
	works with plink.exe but breaks pscp.exe which interprets it as a
	host name and fails with an error 'ssh_init: Host does not
	exist'. The fix checks if what user entered in the "alternative
	host or address field" is a session name and uses different
	command line with pscp.exe
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1715 "automatically expand new firewall and new host
      objects in the tree once they are created"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1732 "Double clicking on object with child objects should
      auto expand them".  Double clicking on objects and folders in
      the tree expands and collapses them, as well as opens object in
      the editor.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1729 "double clicking a folder in the tree should expand
      it rather than open it in the editor".
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1738 "Enable tooltips by default"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      refs #1731 Change double-clicking on "Any" object
      behavior. Tooltip shown for the object "any" in rules says "to
      modify the rule drag and drop an object from the tree here"
      instead of atributes of the object "any". Double click on "any"
      in a rule does not try to open object "any" in the tree and
      editor panel.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1739 "remove 'tooltip delay' input form preferences
      dialog". Qt4 does not allow for changing tooltip delay.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1728 "Update Library drop down menu". Library drop down
      list shows an item "Object libraries:" at the top that can not
      be selected and that always stays on top as libraries are added,
      removed and renamed. The list always stays sorted in ascending
      order. Library names are indented by 2 spaces to make them
      visually distinguishable from the prompt item at the
      top. Implementation uses class ListOfLibrariesModel that
      inherits QStringListModel.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1740 "Deleted library remains in the drop-down list". If
      option "Show deleted objects" was turned off in the Preferences
      dialog and user deleted a library, it remained in the drop-down
      list of libraries and its object tree was still displayed in the
      object tree panel.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1741 "there is no way to undelete a library object".
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1730 "Add background help text and images to empty policy
      window". Showing tooltip in the empty space in the rule set
      view, this tooltip provides hints on how to edit rules which
      should be useful for the beginners.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1743 "change default for the option 'Show text
      descriptions for direction and action'". The option should be on
      by default.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1744 "Add tooltip to the rule number". The column in the
      RuleSetView? where rule number is shown now has a tooltip to
      remind the user that they can click right mouse button to the
      the context menu and use keyboard shortcut "x" to compile the
      rule
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Added text to the tooltips shown for the "Direction" and
      "Action" rule elements to remind user that to change these rule
      parameters they need to click right mouse button to open list of
      possible settings
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      system folders in the tree now have tooltips that explain what
      kind of objects belong there.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      refs #1737 Added "Quick Start Guide" tutorial that demonstrates
      basic features and key concepts of Firewall Builder. The
      tutorial is accessible via Help / Tutorials menu and is shown to
      the first-time user on the GUI startup instead of the "tip of
      the day" dialog.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      refs #1748 "Add dialog about Standard Library when user creates
      first Service object". First time users will see an
      informational dialog reminding them about the Standard objects
      library when they create their first service object.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1745 "Remove path data from text above rules window that
      shows firewall name".
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1746 "Force user to change interface name in New Firewall
      wizard". When user creates interfaces for the new firewall or
      host using manual method and clicks on the "+" button to add a
      tab for the new interface in the wizard page, the interface tab
      is created with blank name. Wizard later checks the name when
      user clicks Finish to create new firewall or host object and
      does not let them do this while interface name is still
      blank. Error dialog reminds that the name of the interface must
      match the name of the interface on the machine.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1733 "Add button for video tutorial link". Shortcut
      button "Watch Getting Started Tutorial" opens page with video
      tutorials in the standard browser.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      added "placeholder" text to the interface name and label input
      fields. This text is displayed in greyed-out small font inside
      the imput field but is cleared as soon as user starts their
      input.  The text gives user a prompt as of what is expected in
      each input field. The "placeholder" text support is available
      only in Qt 4.7 and later so the code is conditional on the
      version of Qt.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1718 "Inspect generated files" dialog says "Multiple
      firewalls" even when there is only one
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>

  <li>
    <p>
