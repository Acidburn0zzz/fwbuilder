why makefiles in this directory are so strange


mostly because I need to be able to build on Linux/*BSD and Windows
and integrate qmake-based environment with automake/autoconf Makefile
that is needed to properly handle .po files. 

Qmake generates Makefile  using project file po.pro. This Makefile
can only install .qm files prepared beforehand and checked in to CVS.
This is just as well, since I do not have gettext 0.14. on my main development
machine so I can't regenerate .qm files there anyway. The Makefile generated
by qmake will also work on windows.

whenver I need to regenerate .qm files, I log in to a different machine
and use POmakefile:

cd po
make -f POmakefile update-po
