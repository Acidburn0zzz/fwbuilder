    <h1>		Firewall Builder Release Notes </h1>
    <br>
    <h2> Version  2.0.7   </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Released 05/08/2005
      <br>
      <b>GUI and compilers v2.0.7 require API library libfwbuilder version 2.0.7</b>
      <br>
    <h2>Summary </h2>
    <p>
      This is a bug fix release
    <p>
      <b>For those who wish to build from source, instructions are outlined
        in the document "Install and Build instructions" on our web site <a
          href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/archives/cat_installation.html">here</a></b>

    <h2>What's new</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improvements in the GUI
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>implemented feature req. #1151220: "Close" button should
            change is caption/title to "Install". When user clicks
            "Install" toolbar button or main menu item, the "Close"
            button in the pop-up window that displays compiler progress
            changes its text caption to "Install"</li>
          
          <li>implemented feature request #1151206: "Search for IP
          Addresses". "Find" dialog searches for objects by a
          combination of name and one of the following attributes:
          address, tcp/udp port, ip protocol number or icmp message
          type. Regular expressions can be used for both name and
          attribute.</li>

          <li>Support for SNMP operations has been added in Windows
          packages of Firewall Builder</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Improvements in built-in installer:
        <p>
          User can specify additional command line parameters for ssh
          that built-in installer runs to access firewall. This allows
          for alternative ssh port or alternative ssh identity to be
          used when accessing firewall. Parameters can be added in the
          "Installer" tab of firewall settings dialog for all
          platforms.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>Improvements in compiler for ipfilter fwb_ipf
        <p>
          Added support for dynamic addresses in ipfilter. Actual
          address of dynamic interface is now determined at run-time
          in the policy activation script &lt;firewall_name&gt;.fw
          generated by fwbuilder. If dynamic interface is used
          somewhere in the policy or nat rules, it will be replaced
          with its actual address by activation script before
          configuration is sent to ipf or ipnat for activation. This
          run-time substitution is done only if a checkbox is checked
          in the "Script options" tab of firewall settings
          dialog. Default behavior is to use "any". This is because
          ipfilter configuration files &lt;firewall&gt;-ipf.conf and
          &lt;firewall&gt;-nat.conf that rely on run-time substitution
          of dynamic interface address can not be loaded using
          standard activation scripts that come with FreeBSD.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generated script uses function getaddr() to determine
          address of dynamic interface. This function falls back to
          0.0.0.0/32 if dynamic interface has not been assigned an
          address yet or is down. Ipfilter policy using run-time
          substitution of dynamic interface addresses will be
          functional even if these interfaces are down or do not have
          IP address.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>Improvements in compiler for iptables fwb_ipt
        <p>
          Generated iptables script sets default policies to DROP in
          all ipv6 filter chains. More detailed control can be
          implemented using prolog or epilog scripts.
        <p>
          Note that this changes behavior of the generated iptables
          script with respect to IPv6. Until now, the script just
          ignored IPv6 but some people felt this leaves a hole in the
          firewall and asked me to make the script close it. Generated
          shell code will check if ip6tables is installed on the
          system and if it actually works before setting default
          policies to DROP. This means it won't try to do it if
          ip6tables is not installed or if it is present, but IPv6 is
          not compiled into the kernel (so ip6tables does not work and
          generates errors).
        </p>
      </li>

    <h2>Bugs fixed in GUI:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>bug #1151052: "Not external interfaces marked as
      external". Dialog for an interface object that belongs to a host
      should not show checkbox "external (insecure) interface"</li>

      <li>bug #1151212: "Collapsed sub-objects shouldn't be added if
      they are hidden". When user selects multiple objects in the tree
      some of which have child objects, those child objects used to be
      also selected and added to groups in addition to their parent
      objects via drag-and-drop operation.</li>

      <li>bug #1151243: "Maintain format of description text". The GUI
      ignored text formatting in object comment when displayed it in
      the info panel (lower left corner of the main windows)</li>

      <li>bug #1155163: "print does not print group contents". The
      program printed only number of objects contaned in object or
      service groups. Now it prints lists of member objects for all
      groups used in rules. If groups contain other groups, they are
      printed recursively.</li>

      <li>bug #1172620: "Add tcp service object for icslap". Added
      this object to the objects library "Standard".</li>

      <li>bug #1184791: "can not copy/paste multiple objects into a
      group"</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Bugs fixed in API:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        bug #1158870: "mutexes are not properly created on
        FreeBSD". Mutexes gethostbyname_mutex and gethostbyaddr_mutex
        were never created but used on OS where thread-safe resolver
        is not available.
      </li>

      <li>bug #1151219: "New Host creation window is not well
      dimensioned". Fixed wrong dialog page layout in the new host
      wizard.</li>

      <li>bug #1157976: "patches to make fwbuilder compile under
      NetBSD 1.6". Applied patches.</li>

      <li>bug #1173801: '"&" character in prolog/epilog'. Needed to
      call xmlEncodeSpecialChars to encode special characters in
      firewall options</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Bugs fixed in policy compiler for iptables fwb_ipt:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        bug #1123748: "busybox grep -E". Busybox in floppyfw is
        compiled without support for egrep (or grep -E). Switched to
        using "plain" grep.</li>

      <li>bug #1160186: 'IPTables Compiler - Multiport Issue'. When 16
      or 31 ports were used in a single rule, compiler generated
      command with conflicting options "-m multiport --dport"</li>

      <li>
        bug #1176890: "block IPv6". Generated iptables script sets
        default policies to DROP in all ipv6 filter chains. More
        detailed control can be implemented using prolog or epilog
        scripts.
        <p>
          Note that this changes behavior of the generated iptables
          script with respect to IPv6. Until now, the script just
          ignored IPv6 but some people felt this leaves a hole in the
          firewall and asked me to make the script close it. Generated
          shell code will check if ip6tables is installed on the
          system and if it actually works before setting default
          policies to DROP. This means it won't try to do it if
          ip6tables is not installed or if it is present, but IPv6 is
          not compiled into the kernel (so ip6tables does not work and
          generates errors).
      </li>

      <li>bug #1176890: "block IPv6". Generated iptables script sets
      default policies to DROP in all ipv6 filter chains. More
      detailed control can be implemented using prolog or epilog
      scripts.</li>

      <li>bug #1179103: 'compiled rules can not be
      installed'. Generated iptables script could not be used on
      systems with non-English locale where timezone name used local
      characters because these characters were printed as hex (
      "&amp;#21488;" ) and '&amp;' caused problems with shell. Now using
      single quotes to make shell ignore any characters in the
      string. Will deal with proper printing of localazed timezone
      later.</li>

      <li>bug #1181359: "Missing traling space in "INVALID state"
      syslog message"</li>

      <li>bug #1195201: "getaddr function return error ip address". Yet
      another change in the way we use grep to find IP addresses of an
      interface on Linux. We can't use regex (bug #1123748) and need
      to filter out secondary addresses from the "ip addr show"
      output. It looks like "grep -v :" neatly solves the problem
      without using regex.</li>
      
    </ul>

    <h2>Bugs fixed in policy compiler for pf fwb_ipf:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>bug #1173067: "support for port ranges in NAT rules
      (ipfilter)" - policy compiler for ipfilter should split DNAT
      rules (rdr) that use TCP or UDP objects with port ranges. A
      warning is issued if more than 20 rules are created.
      </li>

      <li>bug
	#1173064: "support for dynamic interfaces in ipfilter". Actual
	address of dynamic interface is now determined at run-time in the
	policy activation script &lt;firewall_name&gt;.fw generated by
	fwbuilder. If dynamic interface is used somewhere in the policy or
	nat rules, it will be replaced with its actual address by
	activation script before configuration is sent to ipf or ipnat for
	activation. This run-time substitution is done only if a checkbox
	is checked in the "Script options" tab of firewall settings
	dialog. Default behavior is to use "any". This is because ipfilter
	configuration files &lt;firewall&gt;-ipf.conf and &lt;firewall&gt;-nat.conf
	that rely on run-time substitution of dynamic interface address
	can not be loaded using standard activation scripts that come with
	FreeBSD.
        <p>
	This also fixes another problem in fwb_ipf where it generated rdr
	and nat commands with address 0.0.0.0/32 if dynamic interface was
	used in a NAT rule.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Bugs fixed in policy compiler for pf fwb_pf:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>bug #1176051: "incorrect rule generated for TCP service
      ftp-data". If a rule used several TCP or UDP service objects and
      one of them has source port range configured, generated PF
      filter rule incorrectly matched on a combiantion of that source
      port range _and_ destination port ranges from all other service
      objects. This bug affected compilers for OpenBSD PF and ipfilter</li>
