Summary

   This is a bug fix release

   For those who wish to build from source, instructions are outlined in the
   document "Install and Build instructions" on our web site here

What's new

     * Added support for Cisco FWSM. This includes recognition of
       platform-specific options and parameters for FWSM v2.3 (based on PIX
       6.3), as well as interaction with FWSM in built-in policy installer.
       Firewall Builder for PIX v1.1.10 is required to generate configuration
       compatible with FWSM.
     * Improvements in the GUI

          * Feature Request #1225393 "Print comments on objects"
          * Feature Request #1187461 "Add "commit" menu item". This menu item
            commits opened data file to RCS but keeps it opened so the user
            can continue editing.
          * Spanish translation has been added, thanks to Carlos Lozano
            <clozano@andago.com>

Bugs fixed in the GUI:

     * bug #1254775: "RCS checkin fails on Windows when data file is too
       big". RCS tools failed to check the file in if it consisted of one
       huge line of text. This fix makes th GUI save data file (.fwb) in
       formatted form on Windows, just like on Linux. This means each XML
       element is saved on separate line instead of all of them being on the
       same line.
     * bug #1226069: "Segfault: Drag&Drop between two instances". If user
       started two instances of the GUI and tried to drag and drop objects
       between them, the instance receiving an object crashed.
     * bugs #1233165: "Illegal Logging-Limit string" and #1287755: "i18n is
       breaking iptables script". The GUI stored options of the "limit"
       module as translated strings instead of standard attributes.
     * bug #1240205: "Iilegal --log-level Information". The GUI stored log
       levels as translated strings instead of standard attributes.
     * bug #1277129: "script is truncated when installed by the GUI running
       on Mac". Built-in installer truncated firewall script while copying it
       to the firewall if GUI was running on Mac OS X and the script was
       relatively large. This bug triggered only on Mac OS X.

Bugs fixed in policy compiler for PF:

     * bug #1276083: "Destination NAT rules". Old restriction on "rdr" rules
       that required service in OSrv is not valid anymore, pf supports rdr
       rules with no protocol specification.
