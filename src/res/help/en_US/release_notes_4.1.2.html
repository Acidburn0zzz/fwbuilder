<h2>GUI Updates</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1703 "importing iptables line with module pkttype causes
      parser error". We do not have any object with the behavior
      closely resembling that of iptables module "pkttype" so the
      importer creates CustomService object with the code taken from
      the original iptables rule. SF bug 3065435
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed SF bug 3049665 "Firewall Settings -&gt; Output file name
      misses .fw extension"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed how we append suffix ".fw" to the name of generated script
      when it is preconfigured in the firewall settings dialog and
      already includes ".fw" suffix (it was added twice).
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Fixed #1699 installation session status was reset from "failure"
      to "success" in a configuration where fwbuilder gui was running
      on Windows and talked to Cisco router using pscp.exe and
      plink.exe and ssh session failed because of authentication
      failure. This happened because plink.exe terminated with return
      status "success" even in case of authentication failure.
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>
