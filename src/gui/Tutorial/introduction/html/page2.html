<h2>Common Actions</h2>

<p>
  <ul>

    <li><b>Create New Objects.</b> Create new objects by clicking on the
      New Object button or by browsing in the object tree to the type of
      object you want to create, then right click and select the New
      ... entry that matches the desired object type.</li>

    <li><b>Edit Objects.</b> Edit objects by double-clicking to open
      them in the Editor Window.  Changes to object attributes, like
      name, take effect immediately.</li>

    <li><b>Create New Rules.</b> Double-clicking a firewall's Policy
      object will open it in the Rules Window. Click on the green +
      button to add a new rule to the Policy.</li>

    <li><b>Drag-and-Drop Objects.</b> To configure your rule, drag
      objects from the object tree to the rule field you want to change.
      For example, dragging-and-dropping a network object in the Source
      field will change the source to use that network object.</li>

    <li><b>Switch Libraries.</b> Firewall Builder comes with many
      commonly used objects predefined in the Standard Library.  The
      User Library contains the user created objects.  To switch
      libraries click on the drop down list at the top of the Object
      Window.  Objects in both the Standard & User Libraries can be
      dragged directly to a firewall rule.</li>
  </ul>
