<h1>		Firewall Builder Release Notes </h1>
<br>
<h2> Version  2.1.15   </h2>
<br>
<p>
Released 12/10/2007
<br>
<b>GUI and compilers v2.1.15 require API library libfwbuilder version 2.1.15</b>
<br>
<h2>Summary </h2>
<p>
This is another bugfix release. Several problems with policy installer
running in batch mode have been fixed, also this release resolves
compatibility issues with Windows Vista and Mac OS X Leopard.

<p>
<b>For those who wish to build from source, instructions are outlined
in the document "Install and Build instructions" on our web site <a
href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/archives/cat_installation.html">here</a></b>

<p>
The GUI code is in the freeze for QT4 conversion. I will fix bugs in
policy compilers but will try to avoid changes in the GUI. New GUI
based on QT4 will be released next spring when KDE4 is included in all
major Linux distributions and FreeBSD. There will be one more bugfix
release for v2.1 if necessary.


<h2>Improvements and bug fixes in the GUI</h2>
<ul>
  <li>fixed bug #1811781: "Batch Install". Built-in installer used
    address of the first firewall of the batch to communicate with
    all firewalls in the "batch install" mode.
  </li>

  <li>fixed bug #1826558: "OSX 10.5 font problem". This problem
    appeared only in Mac OS X Leoprard (10.5) build, other platforms
    were unaffected.</li>

  <li>Starting with build 320 Windows packages install on Vista</li>

  <li>Added Brazilian Portuguese translation by Jose Carlos Medeiros
    &lt;jose@psabs.com.br&gt;</li>

  <li>fixed bug #1821576: "Rule option tracking gives inavlid config
    with default value". Compiler should skip max-src-nodes when it is
    set to default '0' in the GUI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Improvements and bug fixes in the policy importer for iptables</h2>
<ul>
  <li>fixed bug #1812295: "Can't use runtime address tables AND
    iptabels-restore". Script generated by fwb_ipt used "here
    document" if the option "use iptables-restore to activate
    policy" was turned on. This did not work in case policy used
    any tun-time address table objects. Now generated script
    always uses "echo" to generate iptables commands that it sends
    to th standard input of iptables-restore.
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Improvements and bug fixes in the policy importer for ipfilter</h2>
<ul>
  <li>applied patch by <Cy.Schubert@komquats.com> to add support for
      Kerberos rcmd and Kerberos ekshell proxies in ipfilter NAT rules.
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Improvements and bug fixes in the policy importer for pf</h2>
<ul>
  <li>fixed bug #1800875 "'keep state' missing from pass out going
    traffic rule". Compilers for pf, ipf and ipfw were affected.
  </li>

</ul>
