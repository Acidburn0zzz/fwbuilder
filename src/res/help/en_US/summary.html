<h1>The 5 minutes introduction to Firewall Builder</h1>

<p>
  If this is the first time you try Firewall Builder, we recommend you
  start with<br>
  <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/getting-started-4.0.0.html">
    <font size="+1">Getting started guide</font></a> on our project
    web site. The same Guide is also available inside the program, you
    can launch it using main menu "Help/Tutorials".
</p>

<p>
 Information about new features and changes in this version of the
 program is available in <a href="file:release_notes_4.0.0.html">Release Notes v4.0</a>
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  Firewall Builder helps you write and manage configuration for your
    firewalls. It writes iptables shell script, pf.conf file, Cisco
    router access lists or PIX configuration for you. You can then
    copy and paste configuration generated by Firewall Builder, copy
    the file manually or using your own scripts, or use built-in
    function to configure the firewall.  Firewall Builder provides
    change control and search functions. It allows you to reuse the
    same address and service objects in rules of many firewalls. It
    simplifies coordinated changes of the rules in multi-vendor
    environments and helps avoid errors in generated configurations.
</p>

<p>
  Firewall Builder can generate complex <strong>iptables</strong>,
  <strong>PF</strong>, <strong>Cisco IOS extended access
    lists</strong>, <strong>Cisco ASA (PIX)</strong>
    configurations. You do not have to remember all the details of
    their syntax and internal operation. This saves time and helps
    avoid errors.
</p>

<p>
  Rules built in the GUI look exactly the same and use the same set of
  objects that describe your network regardless of the actual firewall
  platform you use. You only need to learn the program once to be able
  to build or modify basic configuration for iptables, PF, or Cisco
  routers or firewalls. Already an expert in one or several firewall
  platforms? Firewall Builder can help you utilize advanced features
  too.
</p>

<p>
  Configuration files for the target firewall are auto-generated so
  they don't have syntax errors and typos. Firewall Builder has
  information about features and limitations of supported firewall
  platforms. Avoid detecting errors when you actually enter commands
  on the firewall, when it is already too late. Fwbuilder helps you
  avoid many types of errors in the first place, for example it can
  detect rule shadowing, one of the signs of errors in the policy
  structure.
</p>

<p>
  Create an object to represent your network, a server or service once
  and use it many times. Port number or an address changes ? No need
  to scan all rules of all routers and firewalls to find it. Just
  change it in the object, recompile and push updated configuration
  and you are done. At the same time, the GUI provides
  <strong>powerful search functions</strong> that help you find all
  rules of all firewalls that use some object and
  perform <strong>search and replace</strong> operations.
</p>

<p>
  If you work for a large distributed organization with many
  administrators, you can assemble address and service objects that
  describe your network in a library and save it to a data file, then
  distribute it for other administrators to use. You can create your
  own templates for the firewall objects and rules and use them to
  quickly create new configurations.
</p>

<p>
  Firewall Builder helps perform transitions between different
  versions of the same firewall
  (<strong>iptables</strong>, <strong>PF</strong>, <strong>PIX</strong>);
  from one platform to another; from <strong>IPv4 to IPv6</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  You work with an abstract policy that operates with objects. We
  spend time studying differences between iptables and PIX or between
  different versions of each so that you don't have to.
</p>

<p>
  Firewall Builder makes it easy to add IPv6 rules to the existing
  firewall policy. Create objects describing your IPv6 network, add
  them to the same rule set that defines your security policy for
  IPv4 and configure it as "mixed IPv4+IPv6 rule set". The program
  will generate two configurations from it, one for IPv4 and another
  for IPv6, using correct objects for each. There is no need to
  maintain two policies in parallel for the whole time of transition
  from IPv4 to IPv6.
</p>

<p>
  You can generate configuration for a range of devices starting from
  small <strong>Linksys</strong>, <strong>D-Link</strong> and other
  routers running <strong>DD-WRT</strong> or <strong>OpenWRT</strong>,
  to firewalls running <strong>Linux</strong>, <strong>FreeBSD</strong>
  or <strong>OpenBSD</strong> on a regular or purpose-built PC,
  to <strong>Cisco routers</strong> and <strong>Cisco ASA
  (PIX)</strong> firewalls.
</p>

<p>
  Firewall Builder has been designed to manage both <strong>dedicated
    remote firewalls</strong> and <strong>local firewall
    configurations</strong> for servers, workstations and laptops.
</p>

<p>
  Firewall Builder can generate scripts that set
  up <strong>interfaces</strong>, <strong>IP
  addresses</strong>, <strong>SNMP</strong>, <strong>NTP</strong>
  and <strong>logging</strong> parameters and other aspects of the
  general configuration of the firewall machine.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Make coordinated changes in multi-vendor
  environments</strong>: Do you have Cisco routers with extended
  ACLs, dedicated Cisco ASA (PIX) firewalls, Linux or BSD firewalls
  and servers and need to make changes in configurations of all
  these devices to enable new service ? Firewall Builder helps you
  make coordinated changes in an environment like this.
</p>

<p>
  Have all the advantages of the GUI and object-oriented policy design
  with your existing firewalls and routers, be it Linux, BSD or Cisco
  devices. Protect your investment, there is no need to throw them
  away if you are happy with their performance. You can import
  existing configuration into Firewall Builder (currently only
  iptables and Cisco routers configurations).
</p>

<p>
  Built-in policy installer is flexible, uses ssh for secure
  communication channel to the firewall and has many safeguards to
  make sure you never cut yourself off the firewall in case of a
  mistake in the policy. It can deploy to one firewall or to many
  firewalls and routers in a batch job.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Is this new stuff?</strong>  Not at all. The project has
  been registered
  on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fwbuilder/">SourceForge</a>
  in 2000 and
  on <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/fwbuilder">Freshmeat</a>
  in 2001. Since then it went through several major releases. Open
  Source version is distributed under GPL and is included in major
  Linux distributions and is part of FreeBSD and OpenBSD ports
  system. <span class="notranslate">Firewall Builder</span> is dual
  licensed, packages for Windows and Mac OS X are distributed under
  traditional EULA for reasonable
  fee. <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/docs/firewall_builder_licensing.html">More...</a>

<p>
  We have lots of documentation online. Start with Firewall Builder
  Users Guide (available in <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/UsersGuide4.pdf">pdf</a>
  and <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/docs/users_guide/book1.htm">html</a> formats). Users
  Guide explains the program in details and includes large "CookBook"
  section that presents typical problems of firewall rules design and
  demonstrates how they can be solved with Firewall Builder. There is
  also <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/docs/firewall_builder_faq.html">FAQ</a>,
  <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/docs/firewall_builder_installation.html">Installation
    Guide</a> and

    Notes</a> for each version.
