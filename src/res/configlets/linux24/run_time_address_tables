## this function checks if ipset actually can work on the system note
## that we check if it is present separately in check_utilities
## configlet By this time, it is assumed the utility is installed and
## is available, but we still need to check if it works properly
## because it also depends on the kernel module.
##
## ipset -V  checks the version of ipset utility and kernel module and
## is a good way to check if the utility can communicate with the module.
## Unfortunately "ipset -V" returns 0 return code even in the case of
## an error. Will use "ipset --list" which fails when it can't talk to
## the module and then use ipset -V to get diagnostics.

## reloads ipset from the data file. The file must have one address
## per line.  The difficulty with ipset is that no set type accepts a
## mix of individual ip addresses and CIDR blocks. Set type iphash
## takes only ip addresses and type nethash takes only CIDR blocks
## with netmask between 1 and 31 bits (no 32 bits). Will check if data
## file contains only addresses or subnets and decide on the type.
## This means the data file can not contain a mix of addresses and
## subnets.
