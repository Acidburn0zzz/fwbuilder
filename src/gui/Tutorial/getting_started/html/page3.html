  Clicking "Next" brings us to the next page of the wizard where we
  can change configuration of the interfaces of the template firewall.
  Template object is preconfigured with generic IP addresses that
  likely do not match addressing scheme you use on your network. This
  page of the wizard allows you to change addresses to match your
  setup.
</p>

<p>
  Here each tab represents an interface of the firewall (eth0, eth1,
  eth2 and lo). You can change interface name, label, its type and
  edit, add or remove IP addresses. You can manage both IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses on this page of the wizard.
</p>

<p>
  After you adjust IP addresses of all interfaces, click Finish button
  to create firewall object.
