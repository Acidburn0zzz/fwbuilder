<h1>Firewall Builder 4.0.2 Release Notes</h1>

<p>
  This release focuses on the improvements for the GUI usability and
  policy importer for iptables. The GUI offers several buttons that
  serve as shortcuts to the most popular operations new user needs to
  use to get started working with fwbuilder. A new function and
  toolbar button allows the user to inspect generated firewall
  configuration files from within the GUI.

  <li>
    <p>
      using separate settings object and file in the .ini format to
      store instance uuid to ensure uuid persistence on windows across
      upgrades done with complete deinstall. Fixes #1497
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1489 removed unnecessary debugging messages.
    </p>
  </li>
    

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1490 compile problem with Qt 4.7
    </p>
  </li>
    

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1501 call qsrand(seed) to seed random generator before
      generating new UUID
    </p>
  </li>
    

  <li>
    <p>
      applied patch from slif@bellsouth.net to fix compiler
      warnings. Patch applied partially since not all fixes were
      appropriate. fixes #1510
    </p>
  </li>
    

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed SF bug #3013532 "file chooser dialog for import policy
      does not show all files".
    </p>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <p>
	fixed SF bug #3013855 "various fixes for run_tests". Applied
	patch suggested by Michael J. Slifcak (with changes).
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed SF bug #3013735 "invalid pixmap properties during
      make". Fixed uic warnings.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1499 "GroupObjectDialogTest.cpp does not compile with gcc
      3.4.6" and SF bug 3015307.  There is no reason to make method
      insertObject() protected which caused problems (and hacky
      workaround) in the unit test.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>added user work flow progress flags for an attempted install and
      first successful install. Both flags are Boolean true/false
      indicating that the even occurred. We do not track and do not
      report any information about the firewall, platform, rules
      etc. These flags will be used to determine how many users
      abandon the program before even trying to run install for real
      because it is too complicated or the UI is not good
      enough. Fixes #1495
    </p>
  </li>
    

  <li>
    <p>added user work flow flag indicating that ssh/scp have been
      configured in the Preferences dialog. The flag is Boolean and
      registers only the fact that something was entered in ssh and
      scp fields. Actual path and programs used are not registered and
      reported. Fixes #1496
    </p>
  </li>
    

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed bug 3016720 "import policy disabled after file
      close". Menu items "File/Import Library" and "File/Import
      policy" became disabled after user closed data file using
      "File/Close" and never became enabled again.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1521 "GUI crashes upon exit on CentOS 5". This fixes
      SourceForge bug reports 3016482 "segfault with RHEL5 pre-built
      packages on CentOS 5.5" and 3015979 "fwbuilder not exiting in
      centos 5.5"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1493 "workflow icons in the big empty space". The GUI
      shows big buttons in the empty space in the right hand side of
      the main window when no firewall policy is not opened yet. These
      buttons provide simple shortcuts to the workflow functions
      useful for the novice users. Currently this includes "Create new
      firewall", "Import configuration of existing firewall" and
      "Watch Getting Started Tutorial".
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed SF bug 3016680 "Vertical scrollbar issue" rules with a lot
      of objects did not scroll properly vertically.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1520 ("Comment field display clips comment text"
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1526 "Make sure GUI unit tests work in the environment
      where user turned off tip of the day dialog". Unit tests now use
      alternative settings file with all default values and do not
      depend on user's preferences.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      See #1346. Viewer panel that can be used to inspect generated
      firewall configuration files from within the GUI. The panel can
      be opened using a button in the mini-toolbar above firewall
      rules or as a page in the compile and install wizard.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      SF bug 3020381: "Line failure should abort remote firewall
      install". If network connection is lost during firewall policy
      activation, policy installer should detect this, disconnect and
      declare installation session a failure.  Prior to v4.0.2,
      installer detected network failures during policy copy (done
      with scp) or when it could not connect to the firewall at all,
      but hang if connection was lost in the middle of ssh session
      used to activate firewall policy. Now using ssh parameter
      "ServerAliveInterval" to make it detect connection failure. This
      does not work with plink.exe on Windows which does not support
      these command line options. Still looking for a solution.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Automatically adding ssh parameters "-o ServerAliveInterval=2 -o
      ServerAliveCountMax=15" and scp parameter "-o ConnectTimeout=30"
      to the path to ssh and scp in the global preferecnes dialog, tab
      "Installer", to activate ssh keepalive.  This way, user can
      change values if they need to. Default values define 30 sec
      timeout which should be rather conservative. On windows
      automatically configuring plink.exe and pscp.exe to load
      parameters of putty session "fwb_session_with_keepalive" that
      turns keepalives on.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      All instllation commands should be on the single line in the
      configlet so they are sent to the firewall as one line. When
      these commands were on separate lines, linefeed characters
      between them appeared on the standard input of command "sudo -S"
      and broke installation process. This only happened in my tests
      when I ran GUI installer on Windows and looked like some sort of
      a race. When all commands are on the one line the problem
      disappeared. Changed only configlets that used sudo as part of
      installation script.
    </p>
  </li>


  <li>
    <p>
      fixed SourceForge bug 3020761 "printing from command line causes
      Segmentation fault". Fixes #1533
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>


<a name="importer"></a>
<h2>Changes in the policy importer</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1511, SF bug 3012953: iptables import parse error
      icmp_type any
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed sourceforge bug 3012953 name of UDP and TCP objects
      created during import should follow the same pattern and not
      include "0-0" for the source ports if they are equal to zero.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      policy importer for iptables can now parse numerical log levels.
    </p>
  </li>


  <li>
    <p>
      bug 3012953: iptables importer sometimes does not recognize rule
      with " ESTABLISHED,RELATED ". Parser properly processed iptables
      rules with state "RELATED,ESTABLISHED" but not when states were
      in the opposite order.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1513 iptables importer should check default policy in
      standard chains. Importer creates rules at the bottom of the
      policy rule set to reproduce default policies in the built-in
      chains INPUT,OUTPUT,FORWARD.  These rules are added only when
      default policy in these chains is set to ACCEPT because
      generated iptables script always sets default policies to DROP.
      Support for this in the mangle table is limited so far, only
      default policies in PREROUTING, OUTPUT and POSTROUTING can be
      implemented. Rules created for the commands that set default
      policy in chains FORWARD and INPUT will generate commands in
      PREROUTING chain instead. We will try to address this in the
      future if there is sufficient demand.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1516 policy importer for iptables should not use
      automatic ESTABLISHED rule. (See also SF bug 3012953).  Policy
      importer for iptables always creates explicit rule to match
      ESTABLISHED,RELATED to make sure it goes into the same chain as
      the original rule. Also in the same fix, importer creates branch
      for iptables rules that match both regular service and state
      ESTABLISHED,RELATED. The service is matched in the main policy
      rule set, while ESTABLISHED,RELATED state is matched in the
      branch.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed SF bug 3015641 "imported REJECT rule changed during
      compile". Importer of iptables rules did not handle properly
      parameters of the REJECT target.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Fixed SF bug 3016779: Policy importer for iptables should
      understand module iprange
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      policy importer for iptables replaces --sport and --dport
      parameters of module multiport with --source-ports and
      --destination-ports to remove grammar ambiguity that arises from
      the use of the same parameters --sport and --dport by different
      iptables modules with different argument syntax.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed SF bug 3017084 "compiler adds extra quote characters to
      log-prefix string".
    </p>
  </li>


</ul>




<a name="libfwbuilder"></a>
<h2>Changes in libfwbuilder library</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Added framework for creating data files with predictable and
      repeatable object IDs and references. This is used in unit tests
      so we can create data files that can be compared.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed missing class variable initialization in class CustomService
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>



<a name="iptables"></a>
<h2>Changes in support for iptables</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1506 SF bug #3011516: generated iptables script tries to
      update ip addresses of unnumbered interface.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1523 "outbound ipv6 rule matching multicast ipv6
      destination is not generated". The rule with network object
      fe80::/10 in source and ipv6 muticast ff00::/8 in destination
      did not produce correspondign ip6tables command. The change
      affects other cases with rules using broadcast or multicast
      objects that should be considered matching the firewall object.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      fixed bug 3001228 "v4.0.0 iptables: NAT not creating interface
      addresses". Iptables script generated by fwbuilder used to
      include commands to configure virtual ip addresses for NAT only
      if option "configure interfaces" was turned on. Expected
      behavior is to generate these commands when option "Add virtual
      addresses for NAT" is turned on regardless of the setting of the
      option "configure interfaces".

<h2>Changes in support for for Cisco ASA (PIX)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      fixed #1491 fwb_pix crashes trying to compile simple rule. Compiler
      should check validity of the object used as network zone of an interface.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      do not verify network zones of unprotected interfaces. Compiler
      does not allow the same obejct to be used as network zone of two
      different interfaces, which caused problems when a vlan parent
      interface has zone "Any". Vlan parent interface can not have
      ACLs attached to it and does not need any meaningful network
      zone, so "Any" is reasonable fill-in choice. However it
      coinsides with network zone of the "outside" interface which
      triggered this check.
