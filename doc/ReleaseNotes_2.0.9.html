      <br>
    <h2>Summary </h2>
    <p>
      This is a bug fix release
    <p>
      <b>For those who wish to build from source, instructions are outlined
        in the document "Install and Build instructions" on our web site <a
          href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/archives/cat_installation.html">here</a></b>

    <h2>What's new</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for Cisco FWSM. This includes recognition
      of platform-specific options and parameters for FWSM v2.3
      (based on PIX 6.3), as well as interaction with FWSM in
      built-in policy installer. Firewall Builder for PIX v1.1.10
      is required to generate configuration compatible with FWSM.
      </li>

      <li>Improvements in the GUI
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Feature Request #1225393 "Print comments on objects"
          </li>

          <li>Feature Request #1187461 "Add "commit" menu item". This
          menu item commits opened data file to RCS but keeps it
          opened so the user can continue editing.</li>

          <li>Spanish translation has been added, thanks to Carlos
          Lozano &lt;clozano@andago.com&gt;</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bugs fixed in the GUI:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>bug #1254775: "RCS checkin fails on Windows when data file
      is too big". RCS tools failed to check the file in if it
      consisted of one huge line of text. This fix makes th GUI save
      data file (.fwb) in formatted form on Windows, just like on
      Linux. This means each XML element is saved on separate line
      instead of all of them being on the same line.</li>

      <li>bug #1226069: "Segfault: Drag&Drop between two
      instances". If user started two instances of the GUI and tried
      to drag and drop objects between them, the instance receiving an
      object crashed.</li>

      <li>bugs #1233165: "Illegal Logging-Limit string" and #1287755:
      "i18n is breaking iptables script". The GUI stored options of the
      "limit" module as translated strings instead of standard
      attributes.</li>

      <li>bug #1240205: "Iilegal --log-level Information". The GUI
      stored log levels as translated strings instead of standard
      attributes.
      </li>

      <li>bug #1277129: "script is truncated when installed by the GUI
      running on Mac". Built-in installer truncated firewall script
      while copying it to the firewall if GUI was running on Mac OS X
      and the script was relatively large. This bug triggered only on
      Mac OS X.</li>

    </ul>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Bugs fixed in policy compiler for PF:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>bug #1276083: "Destination NAT rules". Old restriction on
      "rdr" rules that required service in OSrv is not valid anymore,
      pf supports rdr rules with no protocol specification. </li>

    </ul>
