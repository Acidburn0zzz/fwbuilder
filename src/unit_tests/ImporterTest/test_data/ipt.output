18: Created branch INPUT_state_match_0
18: Warning: Rule matches combination of states 'NEW,ESTABLISHED'. Iptables rules generated by fwbuilder can be stateless (match no state) or stateful (match state NEW). Fwbuilder also adds a rule at the top of the script to match states ESTABLISHED,RELATED. Combination of states 'NEW,ESTABLISHED' does not fit these standard cases and to match it, the program created new Custom Service object.  This may require manual checking.
