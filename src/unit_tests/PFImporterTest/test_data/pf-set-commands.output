Please check that the file you are trying to import is in one of supported formats. Currently fwbuilder can only import iptables configuration saved with 'iptables-restore' command, Cisco routers (IOS), Cisco ASA, FWSM and PIX configurations saved with 'show run' command and PF configuration from a pf.conf file.
