    <h2>Bugs fixed in libfwbuilder API:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>bug #1001725: "object with empty name can not be
      deleted". the problem was caused by the algorithm used in
      FWObject::getPath. If object had had a blank name, the path
      returned by this method would end with the name of its parent
      without slash.</li>

    </ul>


    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Bugs fixed in GUI:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>bug #1001521: "Cant create ICMP service". ICMP Service
      dialog did not save icmp code and type numbers in the object.
      </li>

      <li>bug #1001275: "object duplication fails w/ no action". GUI
      used to not allow user to duplicate IP address object. Now any
      object can be duplicated so that the copy is placed under the
      same parent, including IP address.</li>

      <li>bug #1000862: "Creating groups in Deleted Objects". Library
      "Deleted objects" should not be offered as a choice for "group
      objects" operation.</li>

      <li>bug #1000485: "Firewalls in the drop-down box not
      ordered". List of firewalls in the pull-down that controls
      policy views is now alphabetically sorted on program
      startup.</li>

      <li>there were two TCP Service objects "linuxconf" in the
      Standard objects library. Object with ID id3AED0D6D has been
      removed. It seems this object has been duplicated long time ago
      (at least it was like this in 1.1.2)</li>

      <li>bug #1002388: "Clamp MSS to MTU" option was missing in
      2.0</li>

      <li>bug #1001833: fixed memory leak that appeared when autosave
      option was used</li>

      <li>bug #1003068: "object copy/paste not always working". IP
      address object could not be placed under interface using
      copy/paste operation. Now ip address object can be pasted to
      interface as well as to Objects/Addresses folder.</li>

      <li>Operation File/discard could not be used if the file was
      upgraded.  Changed the way operation File/Discard works: it now
      closes the file, discards all the changes that have been made to
      it and replaces it with a fresh copy of the head revision from
      RCS. This works if user wants to abort file upgrade when they
      switch to the new version of fwbuilder.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Bugs fixed in iptables policy compiler fwb_ipt:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>bug #1004153 "limit-burst = 0 is not valid". Iptables does not
        accept the rule using "limit-burst" option if it is set to
        zero.</li>
    </ul>
