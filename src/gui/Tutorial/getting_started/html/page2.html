<p>
  This page of the wizard shows template objects and their
  configuration. Standard template objects represent firewalls with
  two or three interfaces, a host with one interface, a web server or
  a Cisco router. We'll choose <b>"fw template 3"</b>, a firewall with
  three interfaces, for this example. Click <b>Next</b> to create a
  new firewall object using the chosen template.
</p>

<p>
  Note that the template firewall object comes completely configured,
  including addresses and netmasks for its interfaces and some basic
  policy and NAT rules. This configuration is intended as a starting
  point only. You should reconfigure addresses of interfaces to match
  those used on your network. We'll see how this is done later on.

<p>Clicking "Next" brings us to the next page of the wizard where we can change configuration of the interfaces of the template firewall.</p>
