<p>
  Every object in Firewall Builder has basic attributes such as Name
  and Comment. Other attributes depend on the object type.
</p>

<p>
  Attributes of the firewall object include Platform (can be iptables,
  pf, ipfilter, etc.), Version (platform-dependent) and Host
  OS. Buttons Host OS Settings and Firewall Settings open dialogs with
  many additional attributes that depend on the firewall platform and
  host OS. More on these later.
</p>

<p>
  Object dialogs in Firewall Builder 4.0 do not have button
  "Apply". When you make changes in the editor, object attributes are
  updated immediately as soon as you click on another GUI element or
  hit Tab or Enter.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>Tip</i></b>
  <br/>
  Firewall Builder 4.0 has full Undo/Redo functions of unlimited
  depth. You can monitor undo stack if you open it using main menu
  "View / Undo stack".
