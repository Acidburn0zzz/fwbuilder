<h2>Improvements and bug fixes in the GUI</h2>
<ul>

  <li>fixed bug #1661140: "built-in installer broken in 2.1.9 for
    PF". Installer incorrectly set name for files it copied to the
    firewall if generated configuration consisted of several
    files. Affected platforms are PF and ipfilter because normally for
    these platforms compiler generates two files.
</li>

  <li>fixed bug #1659832: "No compile with QT without STL
    support"</li>

  <li>a workaround for the bug 1629461: "Policy tabs do not scroll @
    window extent on OSX". The tab widget used to show policy, nat,
    routing and policy branch rulesets does not switch to a "folded"
    mode on Mac OS X when it needs to show more tabs that fit in the
    window. Since I can't figure out a way to force it to do that, I
    am dropping "Policy/" from the tab titles for branches to make
    them shorter. This will help users with policies with many
    branches, however it does not solve the problem because as they
    keep adding branches, at some point they won't fit in the window
    again.</li>

  <li>added an item "Where used" to the context menu associated with
    objects in rules</li>
</ul>
